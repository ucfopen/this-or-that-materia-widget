  excerpt: >
    Students must answer a question by choosing one of two images.
  generation_prompt: >
    Each question provides two potential answer options, a correct option and an incorrect option. Answers can either be images or text, but only text answer options
    are allowed unless images are explicitly requested. Text answers should be as concise as possible and should not include any language indicating the choice's
    correctness or format. Feedback options for each answer should be used to elaborate on why the selection was correct or incorrect. Within each question,
    the asset object must contain a key called type that indicates the answer type (text or image).
